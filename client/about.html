                        <p>Welcome to Title Town Furniture! At TTF, we are dedicated to making the move-in or move-out process easier. Our vision is to create a platform where college students can effortlessly buy and sell furniture at below-market prices. College can be stressful enough, our part is to either help you find the furniture you need for your dorm or apartment, or link you with other students to help get rid of old, unwanted furniture. </p>
